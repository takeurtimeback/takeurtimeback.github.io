  Introducing Take Your Time Shares

A new way to give and receive with the space.

This space has always been held together by people not by institutions or endless funding, but by care, time, and small shared acts. As we grow, so does the need for support. We want to meet that need in a way that reflects how we live, how we gather, and how we practice no-work , choosing presence over productivity, connection over output.

This isn’t a membership, and you’re not signing up for anything formal.
It’s a gesture , a quiet way to say: I want to help keep this going.
If you sit with us, you offer a monthly gift. In return, the space offers back , with presence, with gratitude, and small shared offerings.

We’ll be using square to make monthly giving easy for some ,
but if you’d rather give in cash, or offer something else entirely, we welcome that just as much. Come by. Talk to us. Bring what feels right to share.

As a small token, each month Timetakers will receive a limited pin , a quiet symbol of care and continuity. Not as payment , but as a thank you.

You don’t owe us anything. This isn’t a transaction. But if the space has meant something to you, and you want to help it keep unfolding , this is one way to do that.

The door is open.
Take your time , and if you’re ready, take your seat.
<br>
<br>
With love and gratitude,
Take Your Time
