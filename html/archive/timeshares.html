    <p>Hi friends,</p>
    <p>While a lot of us here struggle as individuals to ask for help, as the team and community grows it has become more and more clear to us that we need better ways to compensate the people whose effort, labour and commitment make this bizarre occurrence possible. Additionally, we would like to start to build a safety net for ourselves as well as other community members, as often we feel limited in our ability to support other mutual aid efforts and groups due to our very tight margins.</p>

      <p>However; we are most certainly not here to profit from this community.</p>
      <p>We will not book shows based on how they will sell, we will not remove or restrict our PWYC policies, and we will not use this community to sell high margin products to class vulnerable people.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Instead, we are continuing to lean into our culture of Sharing, by creating an opportunity for those who are able and interested to support our efforts in a direct and straightforward manner.</p>

    <div>
      <p>What we are calling Take Your Time Shares, are not meant to mimic corporate ownership models that promise returns, instead they are simply a literal representation of sharing.</p>
      <p>A small detail, a quiet contribution that acknowledges that since we all share the joy, power and value of this space, perhaps, between those of us that are able, we should share the burden as well.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>We strongly encourage a monthly model, even if it is a much lower amount than you would make on a one time contribution. Having consistency will help us find stability, and plan for effectively the long term.</p>

    <p>We’ll be using Square to make monthly giving easy for some, but if you’d rather give in cash, or offer something else entirely, we welcome that just as much. Come by, talk to us about what you would like to offer.</p>

    <p>That being said, this is not a membership, this is not a threshold, there is nothing beyond here withheld from those who are not in a position to help.</p>
    
    <p>It is an honor to share with all of you.</p>

    <p>With love and gratitude, Take Your Time</p>
