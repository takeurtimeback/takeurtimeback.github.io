            <h2>A note from Take your time:</h2>
            <p>Here we like to say, Principles not Rules. Meaning, while we hope not to have to police people's behavior, we are all making a commitment to pursue a very specific mission together.</p>
            <p>A mission that absolutely requires that we share a certain set of priorities and intentions. We also know that we need pre-prepared guidelines that allow us to react quickly, and in line with our communities values.</p>
            <p>Below are many of the decisions we have already made amongst ourselves, which we encourage you to read. However, what is most important is that you understand why we are here. Which is: to hold a space that is as helpful as possible, for as long as possible.</p>
            <p>This mission naturally creates certain common sense priorities.</p>
            <p>Some are very straightforward: such as not getting evicted, keeping the space clean and usable, respecting everyoneâ€™s boundaries, etc. while others require more active involvement: such as actively combating racism, classism, transphobia, misogyny and all other anti-human ideologies, especially within ourselves.</p>
            <p>If you find any of these principles difficult to commit to, we may ask you to reconsider if this is where you want to be. Additionally, if you find that these principles are not reflected in the decisions we have already made, we encourage you to become involved to help us make new ones.</p>
